+ Remove Resolution
+ Normalization
+ Mean
+ Median
+ Remove data that 1, 2 annotators
+ Calculate frame time
+ Calculate F1-score

Data processing:

+ Remove unnecessary columns
+ Remove empty rows
+ Save to new .csv file
+ Calculate ICC coefficients
+ Calculate correlation coefficients
+ Calculate mean data and plot them
-> Linear relation 


Discussion
+ Video
+ Analysis video
+ Bang F1-score
+ 7/12 has research
+ Correlation
+ Mode, Mean, Median
-> Linear Regression, KNN, SVM good

Conclusion
+ Restate hypothesis
+ Contribution
+ Limitation, Further research
